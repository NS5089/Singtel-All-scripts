	or 
	
	./amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c config.json -s
10, And we are done, you can see custom metrics and logs in Cloudwatch
If you get this error: Error parsing /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.toml, open /usr/share/collectd/types.db: no such file or directory

	touch /usr/share/collectd/types.db
